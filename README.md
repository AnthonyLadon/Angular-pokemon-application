# Pokemon app

This is my first Angular project.
I followed an online French course given by Simon Dieny.
(Thanks to him!)


# Presentation

This app manages pokemons

here is the link of the model:
https://react-pokemons-app-7c88d.web.app/login

In this application we can:

    - visualize a list of pokemons
    - search one specific pokemon
    - click and see the details of the selected pokemon and
    modify them.
